"SVM-Based Classifier for Cats and Dogs Image Recognition"
This project implements a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier to classify images of cats and dogs. The dataset used for this project is sourced from the Kaggle competition Dogs vs. Cats, which includes a large collection of labeled images of cats and dogs.

Dataset
The dataset from Kaggle contains:

Training Data: Images of cats and dogs, with each image labeled according to its category.
Test Data: Unlabeled images for which predictions will be made.
You can download the dataset from here.

Methodology
Data Preparation:

Load Images: Images are loaded from the dataset directories. Each image is read in grayscale to simplify the processing.
Resize and Flatten: Images are resized to a uniform size (64x64 pixels) and flattened into 1D arrays for use with the SVM model.
Feature Extraction:

Standardization: Features are scaled to ensure that the SVM model performs optimally by having all features on a similar scale.
Model Training:

Training SVM: A Support Vector Machine with a linear kernel is trained on the preprocessed training images. The model learns to differentiate between the images of cats and dogs.
Model Evaluation:

Validation: The model is evaluated on a validation set, with metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score reported to assess performance.
Prediction:

Testing: The trained model is used to predict labels for the test images. Predictions are output to a CSV file, mapping each image filename to its predicted label ('cat' or 'dog').
Results
The final predictions for the test images are saved in a CSV file, predictions.csv, which includes filenames and predicted labels. This file can be used to assess the modelâ€™s performance on unseen data.

This project showcases the application of machine learning for image classification tasks, demonstrating how SVM can be used for binary classification problems in computer vision.
